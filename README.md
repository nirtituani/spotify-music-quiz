### Recommended Next Steps
1. Add D1 database to store high scores
2. Implement difficulty levels (easy: show album art, hard: instrumental only)
3. Add playlist selection (e.g., "90s hits", "Rock", "Pop")
4. Create a leaderboard system
5. Add sound effects and animations
6. Implement user profiles and statistics

## üéÆ How to Play

‚ö†Ô∏è **Desktop/Laptop Only** - This quiz requires a computer (not mobile phone/tablet)

1. **Login** with your Spotify Premium account
2. **Click "Start Round"** to begin a round
3. **Listen** to the 30-second song clip
4. **Wait** for the timer to end to earn 1 point and see the answer
5. **Or Skip** anytime to see the answer immediately (no points)
6. **Keep playing** to increase your score!

### Why Desktop Only?

Mobile browsers are not supported because:
- The quiz needs to **hide the song name** from you (that's the whole point!)
- Spotify Web Playback SDK (the only way to hide song names) doesn't work on mobile browsers
- Preview URLs don't work for all songs
- Playing through the Spotify app would show the song name and ruin the quiz
3. **Click "Start Round"** - music will play through your Spotify app
4. **Listen** for 30 seconds
5. **Wait** for timer to end to earn 1 point, or **Skip** for no points
6. **Keep playing** to increase your score!

**Important**: On mobile, you MUST have the Spotify app open and playing first, then the quiz will control playback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Hono (lightweight web framework for Cloudflare Workers)
- **Frontend**: HTML, Vanilla JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Platform**: Cloudflare Pages
- **APIs**: Spotify Web API & Web Playback SDK
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with secure HTTP-only cookies

## üì¶ Data Architecture

### Data Models
- **Game State** (client-side):
  - `round`: Current round number
  - `score`: Player's total score
  - `currentTrack`: Active song details
  - `timeLeft`: Remaining seconds in round
  - `isPlaying`: Game status flag

- **Session Data** (server-side cookies):
  - `spotify_access_token`: OAuth access token (expires in 1 hour)
  - `spotify_refresh_token`: Refresh token for long-term access

### Storage Services
- **Cookies**: Session management and token storage
- **Future**: Cloudflare D1 for high scores and user profiles

### Data Flow
1. User authenticates via Spotify OAuth
2. Tokens stored in secure HTTP-only cookies
3. Client requests access token from `/api/token`
4. Client fetches random track from `/api/random-track`
5. Spotify Web Playback SDK plays the track
6. Game state managed client-side
7. Scores updated in real-time (future: synced to D1)
